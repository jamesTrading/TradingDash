# TradingDash
This is a web runnable dashboard that outlines technical buy and sell points for stocks
and also displays past buys and how they performed, percentage wise. There are a few different buy and
sell strategies utilised to show possible exit points.

The dashboard also shows current volume and price oversell and overbuy points on the MACD and MFI graphs.
Next the page shows fundamental analysis and an overview of the company which can assist in deciding if a company
should be invested into.

Finally there is an options calculator, along with volatility graphs.
